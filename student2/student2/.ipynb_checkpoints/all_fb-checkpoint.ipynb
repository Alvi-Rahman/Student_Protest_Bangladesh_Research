       " 'Protesters halt traffic on Airport Road after students deaths Protesters have blocked Dhakas Airport Road to protest the deaths of two college students in a road accident. Students have been blocking the road since Monday morning, said Cantonment police SI Umme Salma. Police in the area are trying to bring the situation under control. Students from Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College had taken to the streets after the accident around midday on Sunday and vandalised and set fire to several vehicles. Traffic on the important Dhaka thoroughfare had been blocked for about two hours, said Abdul Ahad, additional deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Polices Gulshan Circle. The dead had been identified as Humanities Departments Grade 12 student Abdul Karim and Grade 11 student Diya Khanam Mim, according to a bdnews24 report. Diyas father Jahangir Alam filed a murder case against Jabale Noor Paribahan for causing her death through reckless driving, said Cantonment Police SI Umme Salma. One person has been arrested in connection with the case, said investigation officer Riyad Ahmed. We are trying to explain the situation to the students and remove them from the road.

       " '#FreeShahidulAlam Press Release: 21st September 2018 Friends of Shahidul Alam, a renowned Bangladeshi photographer, photo journalist and social activist, went on a protest walk in Kensington in London on the 21st September demanding his release. Shahidul has been in prison for 40 days since he was forcibly abducted from his house in Dhaka, Bangladesh by detective police in plain clothes. He was tortured while on remand and charged under the draconian Section 57 of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act. After several unexplained postponements, Shahidul was refused bail on 11th September. Since Alams imprisonment, there have been many global protests by way of rallies, exhibitions and statements supporting his right to free speech. 12 Nobel Laureates and many international eminent figures including Sharon Stone, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Sir Anthony Gormley, Sir Anish Kapoor, Sir Richard Branson and dozens of others have made statements calling for his release. British MPs with Bangladeshi roots, notably, Rupa Huq, Rushanara Ali and Tulip Siddique have made statements in support of Shahidul Alam and been critical of the Bangladesh governments suppression of free speech. Rupa Huq raised Alams case in Parliament. The Government of Bangladesh has remained unresponsive to all calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Shahidul Alam and other student detainees. Statements in support of Shahidul Alam include: Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Naomi Klein, Vijay Prashad: Documentation and criticism are elementary aspects of human life. For a state to deny a citizen the right to say what is happening and to be angered about what is happening is a denial of this basic right. Anish Kapoor: His disappearance must be seen as an act against the power of the image. To incarcerate and silence Shahidul is no less an act of tism than was the destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas by the Taliban in Afghanistan. This is a cowardly and shameful act by the Bangladeshi government. We demand the immediate release of Shahidul Alam. ----------------------------------------------------- Free Shahidul Alam demonstration in support Bangladesh High Commission on 21st September 2018. #democracy #bangladesh #humanrights',\n",

Today while I celebrate one friend I am deeply disturbed by the fate of another. And I am again reminded of the possibilities and the consequences of the work we do. Sometimes our work is done at great risk or great personal cost. And I see how different our fates can be depending on the context our work finds, and how our work is understood and interpreted in different countries by different governments. While cleaning out a closet I came across the card of my friend and photography colleague Shahidul Alam, who is affectionately known as the father of Bangladeshi photography. He now sits in a Dhaka prison after he appeared in an interview on Al Jazeera TV and talked critically about the government and its response to students protests last July and August over dangerous bus drivers in Bangladesh. He had been showing Facebook Live streams of the protests (something many people I know have done and can relate to). Last August students shutdown roads in the capitol city after two were killed. . Shahidul Alam was forcefully taken from his home the day after the Al Jazeera TV interview. He has been tortured and now faces life imprisonment for his critical statements, which can seen in a video posted in this article https://www.google.com/amp/s/indianexpress.com/article/world/bangladesh-road-transport-act-student-protests-5294417/lite/ @contactpressimages @majority_world_photography @majorityw #freeshahidulalam',\n",

       " 'On behalf of the Bangladeshi student community at the University of British Columbia, we would like to extend our support to the ongoing movement in Dhaka right now through an assembly followed by a vigil. The death of two students (Diya Khanam Mim and Abdul Karim Rajib) by a traffic racing accident spurred a protest in Bangladesh where thousands of school and college students rallied, demanding the government to take action and implement better traffic rules for safer roads. The students have blocked major intersections in the capital city for the past seven days. Access to the internet has been limited and social media posts related to the rallies have been taken down. There has also been reports of several injuries as a result of attempts to stop their rallies. We believe that everyone has the right to voice their own opinion and about issues they are concerned with without the fear of violence. In order to show our support to the students who are protesting, we are organizing an assembly at UBC (Vancouver Campus) on Monday, 6th August, 2018. We urge everyone to join us, and the online movement to show support to the student protesters. We, the Bangladeshi students of UBC stand in solidarity with the Bangladeshi students for their non-violent protests. Here are the details of the event *Assembly point: At the UBC letters monument beside shoppers (University Blvd and Wesbrook Mall) *Date and Time: Monday, August 6th 8:00pm ***We will be marching back to the Martha Piper Plaza then conducting a vigil.

       " 'Copied from my friend Kesinee Haney\\'s post. : ***CW, violence, sexual assault*** One of my dear friends lives in Bangladesh and is affected personally by this. Not many news outlets are covering this right now, and I only found out because he messaged me and some of our friends about it. This is horrendous. A peaceful protest against an unsafe and corrupt transit system resulting in thousands of deaths per year (over 4000 in 2017) is being violently opposed by the government. This article says it\\'s 25 injured, but more recent reports is saying upwards of 115 students injured. Rubber bullets are being shot, eyes are being gauged out, women are being held hostage and raped...peaceful protesters advocating for safety. I\\'m not sure what else I can do, but I\\'m going to share this to spread some awareness and hope it starts trending...people need to know about this. The local media has been massively suppressed to try and keep this stuff from getting out. Reporters have had their cameras smashed and stolen. The government has shut down cellular data and internet for 24 hours. One of Shaan\\'s friends was actually arrested yesterday for \"spreading rumours\" on FB. Well, they can\\'t stop me from posting, and they can\\'t stop most of you, either! Share, read, and let\\'s help keep these students from being silenced. #wewantjustice #wewantroadsafety',\n",

The main reason behind this is known to all, Many police doesnt hesitate to take bribe which undoubtedly is a crime. But there are police who are teaching us how to check a driving license the proper way, there are police who are protecting us while we are protesting and police asking us if we had lunch this afternoon. If you hate all police just because of a group of vicious police then you should hate all Bangladeshi guardians because there are guardians who dont hesitate to buy leaked questions for their children. If you hate all police just because of a group of vicious police then you should hate all doctors because there are few fake doctors who have killed people with their fake treatments. If you hate all police just because of a group of vicious police then you should hate all teachers because there are few teachers who dont give us the mark we deserve if we dont join their private batch. Hatred should be shown to them who deserves it individually, Most of the police are vicious but its not all of them. Lets hate the inhuman vicious police, not the profession. At the end of the day, there is at least one police trying to ensure your safety, my safety and our safety. Thanks, Azmayeen. #WeWantSafety',\n",

       " ' #FreeShahidulAlam Press Release: 21st September 2018 ... Friends of Shahidul Alam, a renowned Bangladeshi photographer, photo journalist and social activist, went on a protest walk in Kensington in London on the 21st September demanding his release. Shahidul has been in prison for 40 days since he was forcibly abducted from his house in Dhaka, Bangladesh by detective police in plain clothes. He was tortured while on remand and charged under the draconian Section 57 of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act. After several unexplained postponements, Shahidul was refused bail on 11th September. Since Alams imprisonment, there have been many global protests by way of rallies, exhibitions and statements supporting his right to free speech. 12 Nobel Laureates and many international eminent figures including Sharon Stone, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Sir Anthony Gormley, Sir Anish Kapoor, Sir Richard Branson and dozens of others have made statements calling for his release. British MPs with Bangladeshi roots, notably, Rupa Huq, Rushanara Ali and Tulip Siddique have made statements in support of Shahidul Alam and been critical of the Bangladesh governments suppression of free speech. Rupa Huq raised Alams case in Parliament. The Government of Bangladesh has remained unresponsive to all calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Shahidul Alam and other student detainees. Statements in support of Shahidul Alam include: Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Naomi Klein, Vijay Prashad: Documentation and criticism are elementary aspects of human life. For a state to deny a citizen the right to say what is happening and to be angered about what is happening is a denial of this basic right. Anish Kapoor: His disappearance must be seen as an act against the power of the image. To incarcerate and silence Shahidul is no less an act of tism than was the destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas by the Taliban in Afghanistan. This is a cowardly and shameful act by the Bangladeshi government. We demand the immediate release of Shahidul Alam. ----------------------------------------------------- Free Shahidul Alam demonstration in support Bangladesh High Commission on 21st September 2018. #democracy #bangladesh #humanrights',\n",

Never appreciated the mean... ing of the word Freedom to such an extent. I am out, but I remember the friends who are still in Keraniganj Jail and the stories they shared. I miss the sparrows that befriended me, but find myself wrapped in your warmth. It was in Keraniganj that they told me, It is only in jail that you find out who your real friends are. For all of you who stood by me through these difficult 107 days, a salute of solidarity and a huge hug of friendship. A just and peaceful world remains attainable.

       " ' Parts of the Bangladeshi capital ground to a halt for the seventh day running Saturday, as thousands of students staged protests calling for improvements to road safety after two teenagers were killed by a speeding bus. Authorities have pleaded with demonstrators to call off protests that have nearly paralysed Dhaka and prompted foreign embassies to issue travel alerts. Thousands of students wea... ring school uniforms defied rain to block major intersections in the capital from Saturday morning. Teens as young as 13 were seen on Dhaka\\'s notoriously clogged roadways checking whether cars and buses had valid licenses and were in a roadworthy condition. \"We want justice,\" the students chanted as they gathered in some of Dhaka\\'s main public squares. \"We won\\'t leave the roads until our demands are met. We want safe roads and safe drivers,\" said protester Al Miran. Anger has simmered since a speeding bus killed a boy and girl last weekend. Bangladesh\\'s transport sector is widely seen as corrupt, unregulated and dangerous, and as news of the teenagers\\' deaths became a catalyst for public anger after spreading rapidly on social media. An insensitive comment by Shajahan Khan, a government minister with ties to powerful transport unions, poured oil onto the fire. Khan questioned why there was such an uproar over the two Dhaka children but no reaction when 33 people were killed in an Indian bus crash the day before. There have been widespread social media demands for the minister\\'s resignation despite his subsequent apology. The education ministry shut down high schools on Thursday in an effort to quell unrest, promising students their demands for road safety reforms would be considered. Several powerful ministers pleaded with students to return to their classes, amid worries the unprecedented teen outrage could turn into widespread anti-government protests ahead of general elections due later this year. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009, but in recent months it has been shaken by mass protests demanding an end to a decades-old system of discriminatory civil service recruitment. Dhaka suffers from daily gridlock but congestion has been exacerbated by blockades set up across the city since Sunday. The embassies of the US and Australia warned of significant delays and disruptions as a result of the protests across Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. www.7plus.com.au/news #Dhaka #7News',\n",

       " \" An ordinary night downtown Dhaka, Bangladesh ... . I have to admit that one of my memories of Dhaka - a city with a population of over 18 million - is its chaotic traffic. Everyone - from drivers of rickshaws, CNG's, motorcycles and bicycles to cart-pushing vendors - tries to move forward wherever they find a space, inching their way to destinations. . Bangladesh is notorious for unregulated and d... angerous traffic. Since 29 July 2018, thousands of students have rallied in protest after two schoolchildren were killed by a bus racing for passengers. They are calling for the government to take action to improve road safety. The situation escalated into violence after clashes between the students and the police and pro-government groups. . I hope that this brave protest will bring about significant changes in Bangladesh and, more importantly, raise awareness of road safety among general public. I also hope that my country will also learn a lesson from this incident too. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO ) ranked Thailand as the second deadliest country, behind Libya, from a survey of 180 countries.

Please maintain the decency. So that they (you know who) cannot label the movement as hooliganism. 3. We are all with you, make sure common people are not scared. Talk to them, make them understand and assure them that they are safe. This fight is not with common people. Its for the common people. 4. Stay hydrated and take your meals on time. If you need help with food, water etc. Let your near and dear one in the area know. Once again we are with you on this together. 5. Commoners, you dont have to stand and protest to make this work. You can just maintain the street rules and laws. And that would be enough. 6. We all must remember, if we want the change, then we need to change too. If we all maintain and follow the rules, then others will be bound to do the same. 7. If you are travelling via a public transport or using a ride sharing app. One of you volunteer and check the documents of the driver. If he doesnt have the documents, then get down from the transport along with everyone. 8. Use footovers to cross the roads. 9. Make sure ambulances, patients, people who have a flight to catch and people who are heading for Hajj can reach their destination on time. 10. Change will come, maybe not instantly but will come definitely. Lets all help these kids, and build a better nation together.

       " 'Protesters halt traffic on Airport Road after students deaths Protesters have blocked Dhakas Airport Road to protest the deaths of two college students in a road accident. Students have been blocking the road since Monday morning, said Cantonment police SI Umme Salma. Police in the area are trying to bring the situation under control. Students from Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College had taken to the streets after the accident around midday on Sunday and vandalised and set fire to several vehicles. Traffic on the important Dhaka thoroughfare had been blocked for about two hours, said Abdul Ahad, additional deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Polices Gulshan Circle. The dead had been identified as Humanities Departments Grade 12 student Abdul Karim and Grade 11 student Diya Khanam Mim, according to a bdnews24 report. Diyas father Jahangir Alam filed a murder case against Jabale Noor Paribahan for causing her death through reckless driving, said Cantonment Police SI Umme Salma. One person has been arrested in connection with the case, said investigation officer Riyad Ahmed. We are trying to explain the situation to the students and remove them from the road. We cannot say much more at this point. #BengalTribune #Blocked #studentsdeaths #AirportRoad #BengalNews #BanglaNews #AirportRoadAccident #DhakaMetropolitanPolice #HumanitiesDepartment #JabaleNoorParibahan #UmmeSalma #RiyadAhmed',\n",

       " ' Dear Protesters and Commoners, Few suggestions for you: 1. Please make sure you all are wearing your uniforms at all times during the protest. [Protesters] ... 2. Please maintain the decency. So that they (you know who) cannot label the movement as hooliganism. 3. We are all with you, make sure common people are not scared. Talk to them, make them understand and assure them that they are safe. This fight is not with common people. Its for the common people. 4. Stay hydrated and take your meals on time. If you need help with food, water etc. Let your near and dear one in the area know. Once again we are with you on this together. 5. Commoners, you dont have to stand and protest to make this work. You can just maintain the street rules and laws. And that would be enough. 6. We all must remember, if we want the change, then we need to change too. If we all maintain and follow the rules, then others will be bound to do the same. 7. If you are travelling via a public transport or using a ride sharing app. One of you volunteer and check the documents of the driver. If he doesnt have the documents, then get down from the transport along with everyone. 8. Use footovers to cross the roads. 9. Make sure ambulances, patients, people who have a flight to catch and people who are heading for Hajj can reach their destination on time. 10. Change will come, maybe not instantly but will come definitely. Lets all help these kids, and build a better nation together. So that we can proudly and honestly say: Amar Shonar Bangla, Ami Tomai Bhalobashi. #WeWantJustice #SafeRoads #SayNoToRecklessDriving #TogetherStronger',\n",
