       " ' #FreeShahidulAlam Press Release: 21st September 2018 ... Friends of Shahidul Alam, a renowned Bangladeshi photographer, photo journalist and social activist, went on a protest walk in Kensington in London on the 21st September demanding his release. Shahidul has been in prison for 40 days since he was forcibly abducted from his house in Dhaka, Bangladesh by detective police in plain clothes. He was tortured while on remand and charged under the draconian Section 57 of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act. After several unexplained postponements, Shahidul was refused bail on 11th September. Since Alams imprisonment, there have been many global protests by way of rallies, exhibitions and statements supporting his right to free speech. 12 Nobel Laureates and many international eminent figures including Sharon Stone, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Sir Anthony Gormley, Sir Anish Kapoor, Sir Richard Branson and dozens of others have made statements calling for his release. British MPs with Bangladeshi roots, notably, Rupa Huq, Rushanara Ali and Tulip Siddique have made statements in support of Shahidul Alam and been critical of the Bangladesh governments suppression of free speech. Rupa Huq raised Alams case in Parliament. The Government of Bangladesh has remained unresponsive to all calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Shahidul Alam and other student detainees. Statements in support of Shahidul Alam include: Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Naomi Klein, Vijay Prashad: Documentation and criticism are elementary aspects of human life. For a state to deny a citizen the right to say what is happening and to be angered about what is happening is a denial of this basic right. Anish Kapoor: His disappearance must be seen as an act against the power of the image. To incarcerate and silence Shahidul is no less an act of terrorism than was the destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas by the Taliban in Afghanistan. This is a cowardly and shameful act by the Bangladeshi government. We demand the immediate release of Shahidul Alam. ----------------------------------------------------- Free Shahidul Alam demonstration in support Bangladesh High Commission on 21st September 2018. #democracy #bangladesh #humanrights',\n",

       " ' Parts of the Bangladeshi capital ground to a halt for the seventh day running Saturday, as thousands of students staged protests calling for improvements to road safety after two teenagers were killed by a speeding bus. Authorities have pleaded with demonstrators to call off protests that have nearly paralysed Dhaka and prompted foreign embassies to issue travel alerts. Thousands of students wea... ring school uniforms defied rain to block major intersections in the capital from Saturday morning. Teens as young as 13 were seen on Dhaka\\'s notoriously clogged roadways checking whether cars and buses had valid licenses and were in a roadworthy condition. \"We want justice,\" the students chanted as they gathered in some of Dhaka\\'s main public squares. \"We won\\'t leave the roads until our demands are met. We want safe roads and safe drivers,\" said protester Al Miran. Anger has simmered since a speeding bus killed a boy and girl last weekend. Bangladesh\\'s transport sector is widely seen as corrupt, unregulated and dangerous, and as news of the teenagers\\' deaths became a catalyst for public anger after spreading rapidly on social media. An insensitive comment by Shajahan Khan, a government minister with ties to powerful transport unions, poured oil onto the fire. Khan questioned why there was such an uproar over the two Dhaka children but no reaction when 33 people were killed in an Indian bus crash the day before. There have been widespread social media demands for the minister\\'s resignation despite his subsequent apology. The education ministry shut down high schools on Thursday in an effort to quell unrest, promising students their demands for road safety reforms would be considered. Several powerful ministers pleaded with students to return to their classes, amid worries the unprecedented teen outrage could turn into widespread anti-government protests ahead of general elections due later this year. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009, but in recent months it has been shaken by mass protests demanding an end to a decades-old system of discriminatory civil service recruitment. Dhaka suffers from daily gridlock but congestion has been exacerbated by blockades set up across the city since Sunday. The embassies of the US and Australia warned of significant delays and disruptions as a result of the protests across Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. www.7plus.com.au/news #Dhaka #7News',\n",

       " \" An ordinary night downtown Dhaka, Bangladesh ... . I have to admit that one of my memories of Dhaka - a city with a population of over 18 million - is its chaotic traffic. Everyone - from drivers of rickshaws, CNG's, motorcycles and bicycles to cart-pushing vendors - tries to move forward wherever they find a space, inching their way to destinations. . Bangladesh is notorious for unregulated and d... angerous traffic. Since 29 July 2018, thousands of students have rallied in protest after two schoolchildren were killed by a bus racing for passengers. They are calling for the government to take action to improve road safety. The situation escalated into violence after clashes between the students and the police and pro-government groups. . I hope that this brave protest will bring about significant changes in Bangladesh and, more importantly, raise awareness of road safety among general public. I also hope that my country will also learn a lesson from this incident too. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO ) ranked Thailand as the second deadliest country, behind Libya, from a survey of 180 countries. Statistics that we shouldn't be proud of ... :-( . #dhaka #bangladesh #protest #students #traffic #social #awareness #roadsafety #wewantjustice #sathikhom\",\n",

Please maintain the decency. So that they (you know who) cannot label the movement as hooliganism. 3. We are all with you, make sure common people are not scared. Talk to them, make them understand and assure them that they are safe. This fight is not with common people. Its for the common people. 4. Stay hydrated and take your meals on time. If you need help with food, water etc. Let your near and dear one in the area know. Once again we are with you on this together. 5. Commoners, you dont have to stand and protest to make this work. You can just maintain the street rules and laws. And that would be enough. 6. We all must remember, if we want the change, then we need to change too. If we all maintain and follow the rules, then others will be bound to do the same. 7. If you are travelling via a public transport or using a ride sharing app. One of you volunteer and check the documents of the driver. If he doesnt have the documents, then get down from the transport along with everyone. 8. Use footovers to cross the roads. 9. Make sure ambulances, patients, people who have a flight to catch and people who are heading for Hajj can reach their destination on time. 10. Change will come, maybe not instantly but will come definitely. Lets all help these kids, and build a better nation together. So that we can proudly and honestly say: Amar Shonar Bangla, Ami Tomai Bhalobashi. #WeWantJustice #SafeRoads #SayNoToRecklessDriving #TogetherStronger',\n",

       " ' Today marks the 7 day, since the students in Bangladesh, have finally come down on the roads, to join hands and fight their rights to a better future. I cannot fathom into words the atrocities the students are facing right now. Two were brutally killed, lots are being beaten up, attacked by tear gases, girls are being sexually harassed and the political leaders arent allowing any media coverage. ... Anyone who is trying to take pictures/videos are being beaten up until they are dead by the Chatro League and police officers under the Prime Ministers commands. A minister when asked, what he thinks of the situation, points out situations in other countries and blames the students for hypocrisy. The angry teens (the way BBC articles have described them) have done way more than anything in the past 5-6 days, that the appointed and so elected (we all know how the elections go in the corruption rifed up countries) ministers of Bangladesh havent done in the past 47 years. The students have done a fine job in showing, well educating, the authorities on how to handle traffic and brought into notice how there are so many unlicensed, unregistered drivers allegedly driving on the roads making it dangerous for everyone. These students are not just any angry teens acting out rashly, rather, they are highly motivated and determined kids who are tired of being fed the same pathetic excuses by government for years, and decided to stage one of the best organized protests this country has seen. They are only seeking road safety and commute reform. There are no political agendas here. Im proud to see the kids doing such incredible things for a good cause, for a change- they are trying to make our roads safe and that too with no aggression, no muscle power. They are all extremely polite but stern when regulating the traffic, something our traffic police hasnt done. They are standing up for a just cause - road safety. And we might not be there with you, but we all stand with you. #saferoads #safebangladesh #fuckpoliticians #joybangla',\n",
       " \" There will be a time when students will have to return to their classrooms. Whenever that happens, what should we do as a community? Above all, as teachers, as parents and as guardians? Please put away those heavy text books for a few days and encourage the students to reflect on what exactly has happened. We should all reflect on how collective power can ignite collective action for positive ch... ange. What are some of the silences and invisible power dynamics at play here? It is important to recognise that the grievances of adolescents on the roads are not disconnected from the broader, everyday injustices that take place in Bangladesh. The moral compass of the society has completely broken down. It is important to recognise that while some students are protesting, there are other children who are not able to go to school. They wake up at the crack of dawn and work until late night for us. They clean our clothes, they prepare food and they wash dishes. These children die a little every day. Indigenous girls and young women, fight wars that target their bodies. They are targeted on the road and in schools. How many of us are aware of the circumstances that resulted in Krittika's brutal rape and death? Studies have shown that schools can be the most unsafe environments for children. While we should not forget safety on the road, there are children who are bullied in schools, sexually harassed and targeted for being different. There are so many injustices that take place against young people! I can't list them all here. How can we all contribute to a society that is kind, compassionate and inclusive for all? The minister who shrugged off the death of two children is a product of this society that we live in. We have in part contributed to the creation of the demons that now haunt us. In order to fight the institutionalised neglect, discrimination and violence in our community we must first see it. Then we must understand how our greed and materialism contribute to it. Finally, we must stand up against it, always. Our young leaders have shown us that it is indeed possible to change and to imagine an inclusive society. Let us follow their lead but do our part as well. #adolescentsrising #justiceforkrittika #safeschools #saferoads #safehiils\",\n",

The cricketer in the video, Shakib Al Hasan earlier did a Facebook Live to express solidarity with the amazing movement by school children and urged the students to go back to classrooms as their demands have been met. The fan in the video is reported to have requested an autograph and a selfie with Shakib which were given, after which he wanted a selfie video with Shakib which the tired cricketer, going home after a month long hectic tour, couldn't entertain. The fan then insulted Shakib. The video is about what happened next. The fame seeker FB user who posted it with fake caption, initially wrote that Shakib behaved in this way as he was asked a question about the #SafeRoads movement. The offending FB user must face strongest legal actions. #WeWantJustice. # #BBC #CNN #AlJazeera #SkyNews #CCBM #Telegraph #TheSun #DailyMail #TheGuardian #NewYorkTimes #NatGeo #NasDaily #NasDailyGlobal #ProjectNightFall #AlArabia #EuroNews #NBC #CBS #DMP #CTTCU #DhakaMetropolitanPolice #CyberCrime\",\n",

Students shout slogans and block a road during a protest following two people's deaths Students shout slogans and block a road during a protest following two people's deaths. ... More than 20 students were injured when police in Bangladesh's capital fired tear gas and used batons and rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of protesters demanding better road safety. Young people angry over the traffic deaths of two fellow students had been demonstrating for days in Dhaka, culminating in violence in which they threw stones at police. The city of 7 million remained largely cut off, as buses refused to enter the city from other parts of the country. Witnesses and media reports said chaos broke out in as police and ruling party officials swooped in on the students. The protests, which began earlier this week after two college students were struck and killed by a pair of buses, have paralysed Dhaka. Students have stopped thousands of vehicles, including those of top officials and judges, demanding to see whether the cars were registered and the drivers licensed. #wewantjustice #wewantsaferoad #bangladesh #studentprotest #Football\",\n",

       " ' #FreeShahidulAlam Press Release: 21st September 2018 ... Friends of Shahidul Alam, a renowned Bangladeshi photographer, photo journalist and social activist, went on a protest walk in Kensington in London on the 21st September demanding his release. Shahidul has been in prison for 40 days since he was forcibly abducted from his house in Dhaka, Bangladesh by detective police in plain clothes. He was tortured while on remand and charged under the draconian Section 57 of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act. After several unexplained postponements, Shahidul was refused bail on 11th September. Since Alams imprisonment, there have been many global protests by way of rallies, exhibitions and statements supporting his right to free speech. 12 Nobel Laureates and many international eminent figures including Sharon Stone, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Sir Anthony Gormley, Sir Anish Kapoor, Sir Richard Branson and dozens of others have made statements calling for his release. British MPs with Bangladeshi roots, notably, Rupa Huq, Rushanara Ali and Tulip Siddique have made statements in support of Shahidul Alam and been critical of the Bangladesh governments suppression of free speech. Rupa Huq raised Alams case in Parliament. The Government of Bangladesh has remained unresponsive to all calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Shahidul Alam and other student detainees. Statements in support of Shahidul Alam include: Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy, Naomi Klein, Vijay Prashad: Documentation and criticism are elementary aspects of human life. For a state to deny a citizen the right to say what is happening and to be angered about what is happening is a denial of this basic right. Anish Kapoor: His disappearance must be seen as an act against the power of the image. To incarcerate and silence Shahidul is no less an act of terrorism than was the destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas by the Taliban in Afghanistan. This is a cowardly and shameful act by the Bangladeshi government. We demand the immediate release of Shahidul Alam. ----------------------------------------------------- Free Shahidul Alam demonstration in support Bangladesh High Commission on 21st September 2018. #democracy #bangladesh #humanrights',\n",

I miss the sparrows that befriended me, but find myself wrapped in your warmth. It was in Keraniganj that they told me, It is only in jail that you find out who your real friends are. For all of you who stood by me through these difficult 107 days, a salute of solidarity and a huge hug of friendship. A just and peaceful world remains attainable.

       " ' Parts of the Bangladeshi capital ground to a halt for the seventh day running Saturday, as thousands of students staged protests calling for improvements to road safety after two teenagers were killed by a speeding bus. Authorities have pleaded with demonstrators to call off protests that have nearly paralysed Dhaka and prompted foreign embassies to issue travel alerts. Thousands of students wea... ring school uniforms defied rain to block major intersections in the capital from Saturday morning. Teens as young as 13 were seen on Dhaka\\'s notoriously clogged roadways checking whether cars and buses had valid licenses and were in a roadworthy condition. \"We want justice,\" the students chanted as they gathered in some of Dhaka\\'s main public squares. \"We won\\'t leave the roads until our demands are met. We want safe roads and safe drivers,\" said protester Al Miran. Anger has simmered since a speeding bus killed a boy and girl last weekend. Bangladesh\\'s transport sector is widely seen as corrupt, unregulated and dangerous, and as news of the teenagers\\' deaths became a catalyst for public anger after spreading rapidly on social media. An insensitive comment by Shajahan Khan, a government minister with ties to powerful transport unions, poured oil onto the fire. Khan questioned why there was such an uproar over the two Dhaka children but no reaction when 33 people were killed in an Indian bus crash the day before. There have been widespread social media demands for the minister\\'s resignation despite his subsequent apology. The education ministry shut down high schools on Thursday in an effort to quell unrest, promising students their demands for road safety reforms would be considered. Several powerful ministers pleaded with students to return to their classes, amid worries the unprecedented teen outrage could turn into widespread anti-government protests ahead of general elections due later this year. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009, but in recent months it has been shaken by mass protests demanding an end to a decades-old system of discriminatory civil service recruitment. Dhaka suffers from daily gridlock but congestion has been exacerbated by blockades set up across the city since Sunday. The embassies of the US and Australia warned of significant delays and disruptions as a result of the protests across Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. www.7plus.com.au/news #Dhaka #7News',\n",

Everyone - from drivers of rickshaws, CNG's, motorcycles and bicycles to cart-pushing vendors - tries to move forward wherever they find a space, inching their way to destinations. . Bangladesh is notorious for unregulated and d... angerous traffic. Since 29 July 2018, thousands of students have rallied in protest after two schoolchildren were killed by a bus racing for passengers. They are calling for the government to take action to improve road safety. The situation escalated into violence after clashes between the students and the police and pro-government groups. . I hope that this brave protest will bring about significant changes in Bangladesh and, more importantly, raise awareness of road safety among general public. I also hope that my country will also learn a lesson from this incident too.

Please maintain the decency. So that they (you know who) cannot label the movement as hooliganism. 3. We are all with you, make sure common people are not scared. Talk to them, make them understand and assure them that they are safe. This fight is not with common people. Its for the common people. 4. Stay hydrated and take your meals on time. If you need help with food, water etc. Let your near and dear one in the area know. Once again we are with you on this together. 5. Commoners, you dont have to stand and protest to make this work. You can just maintain the street rules and laws. And that would be enough. 6. We all must remember, if we want the change, then we need to change too. If we all maintain and follow the rules, then others will be bound to do the same. 7. If you are travelling via a public transport or using a ride sharing app. One of you volunteer and check the documents of the driver. If he doesnt have the documents, then get down from the transport along with everyone. 8. Use footovers to cross the roads. 9. Make sure ambulances, patients, people who have a flight to catch and people who are heading for Hajj can reach their destination on time. 10. Change will come, maybe not instantly but will come definitely. Lets all help these kids, and build a better nation together.

I cannot fathom into words the atrocities the students are facing right now. Two were brutally killed, lots are being beaten up, attacked by tear gases, girls are being sexually harassed and the political leaders arent allowing any media coverage. ... Anyone who is trying to take pictures/videos are being beaten up until they are dead by the Chatro League and police officers under the Prime Ministers commands. A minister when asked, what he thinks of the situation, points out situations in other countries and blames the students for hypocrisy. The angry teens (the way BBC articles have described them) have done way more than anything in the past 5-6 days, that the appointed and so elected (we all know how the elections go in the corruption rifed up countries) ministers of Bangladesh havent done in the past 47 years. The students have done a fine job in showing, well educating, the authorities on how to handle traffic and brought into notice how there are so many unlicensed, unregistered drivers allegedly driving on the roads making it dangerous for everyone. These students are not just any angry teens acting out rashly, rather, they are highly motivated and determined kids who are tired of being fed the same pathetic excuses by government for years, and decided to stage one of the best organized protests this country has seen. They are only seeking road safety and commute reform. There are no political agendas here. Im proud to see the kids doing such incredible things for a good cause, for a change- they are trying to make our roads safe and that too with no aggression, no muscle power. They are all extremely polite but stern when regulating the traffic, something our traffic police hasnt done. They are standing up for a just cause - road safety.

We should all reflect on how collective power can ignite collective action for positive ch... ange. What are some of the silences and invisible power dynamics at play here? It is important to recognise that the grievances of adolescents on the roads are not disconnected from the broader, everyday injustices that take place in Bangladesh. The moral compass of the society has completely broken down. It is important to recognise that while some students are protesting, there are other children who are not able to go to school. They wake up at the crack of dawn and work until late night for us. They clean our clothes, they prepare food and they wash dishes. These children die a little every day. Indigenous girls and young women, fight wars that target their bodies. They are targeted on the road and in schools. How many of us are aware of the circumstances that resulted in Krittika's brutal rape and death? Studies have shown that schools can be the most unsafe environments for children. While we should not forget safety on the road, there are children who are bullied in schools, sexually harassed and targeted for being different. There are so many injustices that take place against young people! I can't list them all here. How can we all contribute to a society that is kind, compassionate and inclusive for all? The minister who shrugged off the death of two children is a product of this society that we live in. We have in part contributed to the creation of the demons that now haunt us. In order to fight the institutionalised neglect, discrimination and violence in our community we must first see it. Then we must understand how our greed and materialism contribute to it. Finally, we must stand up against it, always. Our young leaders have shown us that it is indeed possible to change and to imagine an inclusive society. Let us follow their lead but do our part as well. #adolescentsrising #justiceforkrittika #safeschools #saferoads #safehiils\",\n",

Students shout slogans and block a road during a protest following two people's deaths Students shout slogans and block a road during a protest following two people's deaths. ... More than 20 students were injured when police in Bangladesh's capital fired tear gas and used batons and rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of protesters demanding better road safety. Young people angry over the traffic deaths of two fellow students had been demonstrating for days in Dhaka, culminating in violence in which they threw stones at police. The city of 7 million remained largely cut off, as buses refused to enter the city from other parts of the country. Witnesses and media reports said chaos broke out in as police and ruling party officials swooped in on the students. The protests, which began earlier this week after two college students were struck and killed by a pair of buses, have paralysed Dhaka. Students have stopped thousands of vehicles, including those of top officials and judges, demanding to see whether the cars were registered and the drivers licensed. #wewantjustice #wewantsaferoad #bangladesh #studentprotest #Football\",\n",

       " ' Dear Awami League, Let me tell you what will happen down the line in the next 5 years. The coming generation will never believe that a corrupted organization such as yours ever had any positive part in our liberation war. They will stop believing how great of a man the father of the nation was. They will never be able to imagine that \"Chatro league\" was ever responsible for anything other than ca... using senseless chaos. They will believe in democracy, but that is not what you stand for now. You will lose your vote bank, but then again we all know how \"fairly\" your elections have been arranged. They\\'ll rebel, they will become a force that not even your dirtiest politics can touch. Dear Awami League, this protest would have had ended days ago if only you guys came down on the streets and talked with the kids to assure them of justice instead of sending down your goons from chatroleague to beat them up. You are getting old, so is your tactics. Change is coming. Sincerely, A random Bangladeshi. #WeWantJustice #NirapodSorokChai #Airportroadcrashprotest #Bangladesh #StudentProtest (copied)',\n",
